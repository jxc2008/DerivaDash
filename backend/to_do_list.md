- Connect all frontend buttons to backend (ask gpt to learn how to do this via flask, axios, and react)
- Within the game itself (make v0 to implement this page), make sure buttons work, and input is read
- Add popups as necessary (score, leaderboard)
- Add about page (about the developers for resume purposes)

If we have time:
- Add education page that teaches players how to do the derivatives and integrals themselves (both with text and diagrams)
- Improve UI of home page as well as GUI within the game
- Possibly make an account system (purely frontend, could ask yix on how he did it for yxfinance)
